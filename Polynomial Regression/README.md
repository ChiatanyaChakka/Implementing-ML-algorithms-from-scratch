# Polynomial Regression

## Model Description
With the help of provided code, we can produce 6 different types of
models varying in the algorithm they use -
1. Gradient Descent without Regularization.
2. Gradient Descent with Lasso(L1) regularization.
3. Gradient Descent with Ridge(L2) regularization.
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent without Regularization.
5. Stochastic Gradient Descent with Lasso(L1) regularization.
6. Stochastic Gradient Descent with Ridge(L2) regularization.

This is done using appropriate arguments to the functions present in the code.
